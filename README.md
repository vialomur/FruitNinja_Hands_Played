# FruitNinja_Hands_Played
Play Fruit Ninja in browser using hand.


How to play:
  straighten the index finger to hold left mouse button for SECONDS_HOLD seconds.
  otherwise it will just follow your hand.
  I've used right hand with palm to webcam.
  
I'm using mediapipe for hand, fingers recognition. Opencv for webcam image capturing. Sellenium to open browser with the game.
